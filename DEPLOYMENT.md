## Deployment Steps

### 1. Final Code Review
```bash
# Run final checks
npm run lint
npm run type-check
expo doctor
```

### 2. Build Configuration
```bash
# Install EAS CLI
npm install -g @expo/eas-cli

# Configure EAS
eas build:configure

# Create production build
eas build --platform all --profile production
```

### 3. Testing Builds
- [ ] Test on physical iOS device
- [ ] Test on physical Android device  
- [ ] Verify all features work as expected
- [ ] Test with production Appwrite instance

### 4. Store Deployment
```bash
# Submit to app stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

### 5. Web Deployment (if applicable)
```bash
# Build for web
expo build:web

# Deploy to hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
```

## Post-Deployment

### ✅ Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Error tracking (Sentry, Bugsnag)
- [ ] Analytics integration (if desired)
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] User feedback collection

### ✅ Maintenance Plan
- [ ] Update schedule established
- [ ] Backup procedures documented
- [ ] Support contact information provided
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues:
1. Revert to previous working build via EAS
2. Update users via over-the-air updates if needed
3. Fix issues in development
4. Test thoroughly before re-deploying

## Success Metrics
