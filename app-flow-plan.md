Pronunciation tests
Vocabulary challenges
Grammar assessments
Performance analytics
Leaderboards
3. Admin Analytics Enhancement
While basic analytics structure exists, more comprehensive analytics features are needed:
User engagement metrics
Course performance data
Language learning outcome analytics
Learner progress tracking
Predictive analytics for student success
4. Language-Specific Features
Audio pronunciation tools
Speaking practice interfaces
Conversation simulators
Cultural context information
Translation assistance tools
5. Technical Implementation Requirements
Verify that state management is properly handling:
Authentication state
User profile data
Language learning progress tracking
Quiz attempt states
Offline language practice capabilities
6. Future Enhancement Areas
AI-powered language learning features:
Personalized learning paths

Summary
Your language learning app has a solid foundation with most of the core navigation structure in place. The pre-authentication flow and main tab navigation are well-implemented. The administrative panel has good structure but needs more feature completion.

Focus areas for development should be:

Building out the language learning experience section with interactive exercises and practice tools
Enhancing the quiz system with language-specific assessment types
Implementing audio and pronunciation features for language practice
Expanding admin analytics specifically for language learning metrics
Adding conversation practice and language exchange features
